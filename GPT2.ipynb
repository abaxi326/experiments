See the line of lights,\\n A chain of stars down either side the street,\\n Why can\\'t you lift the chain and give it to me,\\n A necklace for my throat? I\\'d twist it round\\n And you could play with it. You smile at me\\n As though I were a little dreamy child\\n Behind whose eyes the fairies live.... And see,\\n The people on the street look up at us\\n All envious. We are a king and queen,\\n Our royal carriage is a motor bus,\\n We watch our subjects with a haughty joy....\\n How still you are! Have you been hard at work\\n And are you tired to-night? It is so long\\n Since I have seen you, four whole days, I think.\\n My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts\\n Like early flowers in an April meadow,\\n And I must give them to you, all of them,\\n Before they fade. The people I have met,\\n The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things\\n That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows\\n That hurry, gesturing along a wall,\\n Haunting or gay, and yet they all grow real\\n And take their proper size here in my heart\\n When you have seen them.... There\\'s the Plaza now,\\n A lake of light! To-night it almost seems\\n That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,\\n Drawn somehow toward you. See the open park\\n Lying below us with a million lamps\\n Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.\\n We look down on them as God must look down\\n On constellations floating under Him\\n Tangled in clouds.... Come, then, and let us walk\\n Since we have reached the park. It is our garden,\\n All black and blossomless this winter night,\\n But we bring April with us, you and I;\\n We set the whole world on the trail of spring.\\n I think that every path we ever took\\n Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,\\n Delicate gold that only fairies see.\\n When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks\\n And come out on the drowsy park, they look\\n Along the empty paths and say, \"\"Oh, here\\n They went, and here, and here, and here! Come, see,\\n Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance\\n About it in a windy ring and make\\n A circle round it only they can cross\\n When they come back again!\"\".... Look at the lake,\\n Do you remember how we watched the swans\\n That night in late October while they slept?\\n Swans must have stately dreams, I think. But now\\n The lake bears only thin reflected lights\\n That shake a little. How I long to take\\n One from the cold black water, new-made gold\\n To give you in your hand! And see, and see,\\n There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!\\n Oh, dimmer than a pearl, if you stoop down\\n Your hand could almost reach it up to me....\\n\\n There was a new frail yellow moon to-night,\\n I wish you could have had it for a cup\\n With stars like dew to fill it to the brim....\\n\\n How cold it is! Even the lights are cold;\\n They have put shawls of fog around them, see!\\n What if the air should grow so dimly white\\n That we would lose our way along the paths\\n Made new by walls of moving mist receding\\n The more we follow.... What a silver night!\\n That was our bench the time you said to me\\n The long new poem, but how different now,\\n How eerie with the curtain of the fog\\n Making it strange to all the friendly trees!\\n There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls\\n Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist.\\n Walk on a little, let me stand here watching\\n To see you, too, grown strange to me and far....\\n I used to wonder how the park would be\\n If one night we could have it all alone,\\n No lovers with close arm-encircled waists\\n To whisper and break in upon our dreams.\\n And now we have it! Every wish comes true!\\n We are alone now in a fleecy world;\\n Even the stars have gone. We two alone!\"\\n\"I am not yours, not lost in you,\\nNot lost, although I long to be\\nLost as a candle lit at noon,\\nLost as a snowflake in the sea.\\n\\nYou love me, and I find you still\\nA spirit beautiful and bright,\\nYet I am I, who long to be\\nLost as a light is lost in light.\\n\\nOh plunge me deep in love, put out\\nMy senses, leave me deaf and blind,\\nSwept by the tempest of your love,\\nA taper in a rushing wind.\"\\n\"Time is \\nToo Slow for those who Wait,\\nToo Swift for those who Fear,\\nToo Long for those who Grieve,\\nToo Short for those who Rejoice;\\nBut for those who Love,\\nTime is not. \"\\n\"Love is like water or the air\\nmy townspeople;\\nit cleanses, and dissipates evil gases.\\nIt is like poetry too\\nand for the same reasons.\\nLove is so precious\\nmy townspeople\\nthat if I were you I would\\nhave it under lock and key—\\nlike the air or the Atlantic or\\nlike poetry!\"\\n\"It was many and many a year ago,\\nIn a kingdom by the sea,\\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\\nBy the name of ANNABEL LEE;\\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought\\nThan to love and be loved by me.

Alamo,)\\n  \\'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\\n      young men.\\n\\n  Retreating they had form\\'d in a hollow square with their baggage for\\n      breastworks,\\n  Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\\n      number, was the price they took in advance,\\n  Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\\n  They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv\\'d writing and\\n      seal, gave up their arms and march\\'d back prisoners of war.\\n\\n  They were the glory of the race of rangers,\\n  Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\\n  Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\\n  Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\\n  Not a single one over thirty years of age.\\n\\n  The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\\n      massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\\n  The work commenced about five o\\'clock and was over by eight.\\n\\n  None obey\\'d the command to kneel,\\n  Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\\n  A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\\n      lay together,\\n  The maim\\'d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\\n  Some half-kill\\'d attempted to crawl away,\\n  These were despatch\\'d with bayonets or batter\\'d with the blunts of muskets,\\n  A youth not seventeen years old seiz\\'d his assassin till two more\\n      came to release him,\\n  The three were all torn and cover\\'d with the boy\\'s blood.\\n\\n  At eleven o\\'clock began the burning of the bodies;\\n  That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\"\\n\"  Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\\n  Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\\n  List to the yarn, as my grandmother\\'s father the sailor told it to me.\\n\\n  Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\\n  His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\\n      and never was, and never will be;\\n  Along the lower\\'d eve he came horribly raking us.\\n\\n  We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch\\'d,\\n  My captain lash\\'d fast with his own hands.\\n\\n  We had receiv\\'d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\\n  On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\\n      killing all around and blowing up overhead.\\n\\n  Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\\n  Ten o\\'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\\n      and five feet of water reported,\\n  The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\\n      to give them a chance for themselves.\\n\\n  The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\\n  They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\\n\\n  Our frigate takes fire,\\n  The other asks if we demand quarter?\\n  If our colors are struck and the fighting done?\\n\\n  Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\\n  We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\\n      of the fighting.\\n\\n  Only three guns are in use,\\n  One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy\\'s main-mast,\\n  Two well serv\\'d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\\n      clear his decks.\\n\\n  The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\\n      the main-top,\\n  They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\\n\\n  Not a moment\\'s cease,\\n  The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\\n\\n  One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\\n\\n  Serene stands the little captain,\\n  He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\\n  His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\\n\\n  Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\"\\n\"  Stretch\\'d and still lies the midnight,\\n  Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\\n  Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\\n      one we have conquer\\'d,\\n  The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\\n      countenance white as a sheet,\\n  Near by the corpse of the child that serv\\'d in the cabin,\\n  The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\\n      curl\\'d whiskers,\\n  The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\\n  The husky voices

When thoughts\\nOf the last bitter hour come like a blight\\nOver thy spirit, and sad images\\nOf the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,\\nAnd breathless darkness, and the narrow house,\\nMake thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;—\\nGo forth, under the open sky, and list\\nTo Nature\\'s teachings, while from all around—\\nEarth and her waters, and the depths of air,—\\nComes a still voice—Yet a few days, and thee\\nThe all-beholding sun shall see no more\\nIn all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,\\nWhere thy pale form was laid, with many tears,\\nNor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist\\nThy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim\\nThy growth, to be resolved to earth again,\\nAnd, lost each human trace, surrendering up\\nThine individual being, shalt thou go\\nTo mix for ever with the elements,\\nTo be a brother to the insensible rock\\nAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain\\nTurns with his share, and treads upon. The oak\\nShall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.\\n\\n    Yet not to thine eternal resting-place\\nShalt thou retire alone—nor couldst thou wish\\nCouch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\\nWith patriarchs of the infant world—with kings,\\nThe powerful of the earth—the wise, the good,\\nFair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,\\nAll in one mighty sepulchre.—The hills\\nRock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales\\nStretching in pensive quietness between;\\nThe venerable woods—rivers that move\\nIn majesty, and the complaining brooks\\nThat make the meadows green; and, poured round all,\\nOld ocean\\'s gray and melancholy waste,—\\nAre but the solemn decorations all\\nOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\\nThe planets, all the infinite host of heaven,\\nAre shining on the sad abodes of death,\\nThrough the still lapse of ages. All that tread\\nThe globe are but a handful to the tribes\\nThat slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings\\nOf morning—and the Barcan desert pierce,\\nOr lose thyself in the continuous woods\\nWhere rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,\\nSave his own dashings—yet—the dead are there:\\nAnd millions in those solitudes, since first\\nThe flight of years began, have laid them down\\nIn their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.\\nSo shalt thou rest—-and what, if thou withdraw\\nUnheeded by the living, and no friend\\nTake note of thy departure? All that breathe\\nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\\nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\\nPlod on, and each one as before will chase\\nHis favourite phantom; yet all these shall leave\\nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall come,\\nAnd make their bed with thee. As the long train\\nOf ages glide away, the sons of men,\\nThe youth in life\\'s green spring, and he who goes\\nIn the full strength of years, matron, and maid,\\nAnd the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man,—\\nShall one by one be gathered to thy side,\\nBy those, who in their turn shall follow them.\\n\\n    So live, that when thy summons comes to join\\nThe innumerable caravan, that moves\\nTo that mysterious realm, where each shall take\\nHis chamber in the silent halls of death,\\nThou go not like the quarry-slave at night,\\nScourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\\nBy an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,\\nLike one who wraps the drapery of his couch\\nAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\"\\n\"It was an April morning: fresh and clear \\nThe Rivulet, delighting in its strength, \\nRan with a young man\\'s speed; and yet the voice \\nOf waters which the winter had supplied \\nWas softened down into a vernal tone. \\nThe spirit of enjoyment and desire, \\nAnd hopes and wishes, from all living things \\nWent circling, like a multitude of sounds. \\nThe budding groves seemed eager to urge on \\nThe steps of June; as if their various hues \\nWere only hindrances that stood between \\nThem and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed \\nSuch an entire contentment in the air \\nThat every naked ash, and tardy tree \\nYet leafless, showed as if the countenance \\nWith which it looked on this delightful day \\nWere native to the summer.--Up the brook \\nI roamed in the confusion of my heart, \\nAlive to all things and forgetting all. \\nAt length I to a sudden turning came \\nIn this continuous glen, where down a rock \\nThe Stream, so ardent in its course before, \\nSent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all \\nWhich I till then had heard, appeared the voice \\nOf common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb, \\nThe shepherd\\'s dog, the linnet and the thrush \\nVied with this waterfall, and made a song, \\nWhich, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth \\nOr like some natural produce of the air, \\nThat could not cease to be. Green leaves were here; \\nBut \\'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch, \\nThe yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn, \\nWith hanging islands of resplendent furze: \\nAnd, on a summit, distant a short space, \\nBy any who should look beyond the dell, \\nA single mountain-cottage might be seen. \\nI gazed and gazed, and to myself I said, \\n\\'Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook, \\nMy EMMA, I will dedicate to thee.\\' \\n----Soon did the spot become my other home, \\nMy dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode. \\nAnd, of the Shepherds who have seen me there, \\nTo whom I sometimes in our idle talk \\nHave told this fancy, two or three, perhaps, \\nYears after we are gone and in our graves, \\nWhen they have cause to speak of this wild place, \\nMay call it by the name of EMMA\\'S DELL. \"'"
